# Ensemble-learning

Implementation of Cascade generalisation and stacking with different classifiers such as K-nearest neighbor, Stochastic gradient and Random forest. The project concentrates on the effect of accuracy for any given sequence of classifiers. This experiment proves that the sequence in which we feed the classifiers highly modify the accuracy results.
